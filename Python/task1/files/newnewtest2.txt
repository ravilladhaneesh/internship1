The re.search() method returns a Match object ( i.e., re.Match). This match object contains the following two items. The tuple object contains the start and end index of a successful match. Second, it contains an actual matching value that we can retrieve using a group() method. If the re.search() method fails to locate the occurrences of the pattern that we want to find or such a pattern doesnâ€™t exist in a target string it will return a None type .
